# 💬 DM Delay Button – Day 01 of 30 Days App Challenge

## 📅 30 Days, 30 Apps Challenge

As part of a self-growth and learning initiative, I’ve committed to building **one app every day for 30 days**.

Each project focuses on solving a small real-world problem or practicing a specific concept in web development. The goal is to improve my consistency, problem-solving, and development skills — and share my journey publicly to inspire others.

This is **Day 01** of the challenge.

## 🔥 Project: DM Delay App

This is a simple messaging interface where your message is **delayed before sending**, giving you time to cancel it. Similar to the “Undo Send” feature in email/chat platforms.

This was a task given by my instructor to explore timers, UI logic, and state management in React.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using `setTimeout()` and `clearTimeout()` for message delay
- Managing state with `useState` for message, delay, and timer
- Conditional rendering for "Send" vs "Cancel" buttons
- Using **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN** for clean UI
- Organizing files into components and pages
